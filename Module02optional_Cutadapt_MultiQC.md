# More QC - Cutadapt and MultiQC

In this module we will learn:

* about the cutadapt software and its uses
* how to use the cutadapt tool for trimming adapters
* how to trim all of our samples in a for-loop
* about the MultiQC tool and its capabilities
* how to run multiQC on a remote system, transfer and view the reports locally

# Differential Expression Workflow

As a reminder, our overall differential expression workflow is shown below. In this lesson, we will go over the bold part of the workflow.

| Step | Task |
| :--: | ---- |
| 1 | Experimental Design |
| 2 | Biological Samples / Library Preparation |
| 3 | Sequence Reads |
| **4** | **Assess Quality of Reads** |
| 5 | Splice-aware Mapping to Genome |
| 6 | Count Reads Associated with Genes |
| 7 | Test for DE Genes |

## Cutadapt

[Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a very widely used read trimming and fastq processing software, cited several thousands of times. It's written in python, and is user-friendly and reasonably fast.

It is used for removing adapter sequences, primers, and poly-A tails, for trimming based on quality thresholds, for filtering reads based on characteristics, etc.

It can operate on both FASTA and FASTQ file formats, and it supports compressed or raw inputs and outputs.

Notably, cutadapt's error-tolerant adapter trimming likely contributed greatly to its early popularity. We will use it to trim the adapters from our reads. As usual, we'll view the help page to get a sense for how to structure our command.

Cutadapt Exercise:

1. View the help page of the cutadapt tool
2. Construct a cutadapt command to trim the adapters from paired-end reads
3. View the output of cutadapt, and verify that it's correct
4. Construct a for-loop to trim the reads for all of our samples

```
SAMPLE=sample_01
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAG -A AGATCGGAAGAG -o out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -p out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz reads/${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz
reads/${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz

SAMPLE=sample_02
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAG -A AGATCGGAAGAG -o out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -p out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz reads/${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz
reads/${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz

SAMPLE=sample_03
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAG -A AGATCGGAAGAG -o out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -p out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz reads/${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz
reads/${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz

SAMPLE=sample_04
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAG -A AGATCGGAAGAG -o out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -p out_trimmed/${SAMPLE}_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz reads/${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz
reads/${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz
```

## Re-running FastQC

Now that we've run cutadapt and trimmed the adapters from our reads, we will quickly re-run FastQC on these trimmed read FASTQs. This will confirm that we've successfully trimmed the adapters, and we'll see that our FASTQ files are ready for sequencing.

Re-running FastQC Exercise:

1. Construct and execute FastQC command to evaluate trimmed read FASTQ files
2. View the output (filenames)

```
fastqc -o out_fastqc_trimmed out_trimmed/*.fastq.gz
```

# MultiQC

FastQC is an excellent tool, but it can be tedious to look at the report for each sample separately, while keeping track of what trends emerge. It would be much easier to look at all the FastQC reports compiled into a single report. [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) is a tool that does exactly this.

MultiQC is designed to interpret and aggregate reports from [various tools](https://multiqc.info/#supported-tools) and output a single report as an HTML document.

MultiQC Exercise:

1. View the multiQC help page
2. Construct a MultiQC command to aggregate our QC results into a single report
3. Transfer the MultiQC report to personal computer using scp
4. View the MultiQC report

<details>
<summary>MultiQC solution</summary>

```
multiqc --outdir out_multiqc out_fastqc_trimmed/
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>scp command helpful details</summary>

Make sure you're running scp on your **local** computer, requesting a file from the **remote** computer we were just using.

scp command format, with the address for AWS remote

```
# Usage: scp source destination
scp <username>@50.17.210.255:~/example_data/out_multiqc/multiqc_report.html ~/rsd-workshop/
```

</details>

Opening the HTML report, we see it is organized by the same modules and each plot has all samples for which FastQC was run. We can see the report confirms that the adapters have been trimmed from our sequence.
