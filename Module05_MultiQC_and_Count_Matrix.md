# MultiQC, Count Matrix, Wrap-Up

In this module, we will learn:

* how MultiQC gathers STAR alignment information, for QC purposes
* how MultiQC presents the results of STAR alignment
* how to combine gene-level results into a count matrix

# Differential Expression Workflow

Here we will take the results from the previous module and operate on them a bit further. This will wrap up the day 1 exercises, leaving us well-poised to begin differential expression, which we will discuss on day 2.

| Step | Task |
| :--: | ---- |
| 1 | Experimental Design |
| 2 | Biological Samples / Library Preparation |
| 3 | Sequence Reads |
| 4 | Assess Quality of Raw Reads |
| **5** | **Splice-aware Mapping to Genome** |
| **6** | **Count Reads Associated with Genes** |
| 7 | Test for DE Genes |

# Running MultiQC

After aligning reads it is often helpful to know how many reads were uniquely aligned, mapped to multiple loci, or not mapped at all. The `sample_NLog.final.out` file which is output alongside the alignments in `sample_N.temp/` folder (we used the `--keep-intermediate-files` flag), reports this information:

```

We will run `multiqc`, and it will detect these reports from STAR and include them in the report.

MultiQC With STAR Exercise:

1. Note the contents of our analysis directory, including the STAR contents
2. Run MultiQC on this directory
3. Transfer the report back to local computer and view it


The newly included STAR section will look something like the following:

# Creating the count matrix

We have viewed some of the gene expression quantification results individually. It can be useful to combine these expression values into a count matrix. This is helpful when gathering expression-level QC metrics, as well as for input into a differential gene expression program such as DESeq2.

Count Matrix Exercise:

1. View the `.genes.results` files that we want to combine
2. Understand the process of creating a count matrix
3. View the help file of `combine.py`
4. Construct / execute a command to combine our results into a count matrix
5. View the resulting count matrix

    <summary>Contents of combine.py script</summary>

    There are many ways to combine these results into a count matrix. Here is how this python script we've used, `combine.py`, works:
```

        sample_name = basename(file_name).replace(suffix, '')
        sample_files.append((sample_name, file_name))
    return sample_files
