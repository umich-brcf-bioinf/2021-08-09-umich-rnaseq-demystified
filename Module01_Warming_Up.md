## Warm-up exercise:

1. Try logging into the AWS instance
2. run the command `fortune | cowsay | lolcat`

Optional and only for fun!
We will have time for troubleshooting at the next section.

## Local vs remote exercise:

1. Determine if you are currently viewing a remote or local shell
2. If remote, log out by using the command `exit`
3. Become familiar with the different appearance of the local shell
4. Log back in to the aws instance
5. Become familiar with the differences between the local and remote shell.

## Orientation exercise

Note: We will provide additional time during this exercise to ensure that everyone is prepared to move forward.

Orientation exercise:

1. Log in (or confirm logged in) to aws instance
2. Ensure in home directory with `cd`
3. Use `cp` to copy the data from `/rsd/data/` to your home directory
4. Use `ls` to view references
5. Use `ls` to view input fastq files
6. Use `mkdir` to create a folder for our analysis

1. Log in to remote

        ssh <username>@50.17.210.255

2. Copy data to our home directory

        cp -r /rsd/data/ ~/

3. View our references
        ls ~/data/refs

4. View our input fastq files
        ls ~/data/reads

5. Create a folder for our analysis
        mkdir ~/analysis
